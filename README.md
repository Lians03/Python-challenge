# python-challenge

Hi guys,

This is Shan. Unfortunately, I'm facing some challenges completing the final part of the project on time. I received assistance for the first section during a tutor session, askBCS, and I also used ChatGPT to help me improve the code formatting to make it look more polished.

I'll keep working on the rest of it and aim to complete the project as soon as possible.

Thanks for your understanding 

Best 
shan
