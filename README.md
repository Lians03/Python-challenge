# Overview

This project contains two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll, designed to apply Python scripting skills for data analysis. Each challenge involves reading data from CSV files, performing calculations, and outputting the results in a specified format. These tasks demonstrate the ability to handle large datasets and automate data analysis processes using Python.
